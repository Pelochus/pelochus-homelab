# Software
This README focuses on the hardware used and possible future add-ons/upgrades

## Computer Specs
Orange Pi 5 with the following specs:
**- Rockchip RK3588S:** Powerful enough for running Genshin Impact on Android, approximately equivalent to SD855. Enough for one or two heavy software or many lightweight programs
**- 4GB RAM**
**- Added heatsinks and fan**
**- M.2 NVMe expansion possibility:** Uses PCIe 2.0x1, up to 500 MB/s. Compatible with 2242 and 2230 SSDs. Also compatible with eMMC and SATA SSDs (this one needs extra configuration)

## Storage
**- WD External HDD 4TB:** Used for the whole OS and data
**- Filesystem:** OS default, ext4

## Future upgrades
- Add more disk space
- RAID configuration (Better done on a true server, not an Orange Pi...)
- Change filesystem to ZFS or something more suitable for a server

## TODO:
- Look up more possible ugprades, especially for Orange Pi 5
- Make physical installation cool, with proper cable management and some decorations, like ambient lighting (remember RPi 4 cluster with liquid refrigeration on a wall?)
