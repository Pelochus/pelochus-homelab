Personal home server configuration and automation

### Dynamic DNS
DynDNS is used here due to obvious reasons. I'm using NoIP because ISP's router supports it. Actually, I would prefer to use Dynu since it doesn't require an email confirmation every 30 days, but this router doesn't support it and I don't want a DUC service in my homelab installed. 
**Note to self**: Change once I change routers, if the router supports Dynu.

## TODO:
- See Google Keep, once finished continue with this
- Make a list of apps/services/programs installed
- Learn automation tools different from bash scripts (Ansible?)
- Automate installations of apps/services/programs
- Automate configs
- Docker for ease of setup?
- Think of backups automation (Rsync?) 
- RAID1 in the future?
