# Backups
This section includes what backups are needed, which are recommended and how to backup them if it isn't possible via scripts/terminal

## Full OS backup
Researching

## Important data
TODO:
- Make script
- Select what data needs to be copied

## Software configuration
Some installed services have the ability to backup their data. These are listed here:

### Pi-Hole
Built-in software backup in Pi-Hole's webUI. Do manually, is pretty easy

### PiVPN
There is a command for it, search it up. Probably can be done automatically. TODO FINISH THIS PIVPN SECTION

### More software


## TODO:
- Basically every single script
- Almost this whole readme
- Search up if it is possible to backup & restore Pi-Hole via terminal. Automate if it is possible
